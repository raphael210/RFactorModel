\title{addrtn.hedge}
\usage{
addrtn.hedge(rtn.long, rtn.short, rebFreq = "month", weight = c(1, -1),
  fee.long = 0, fee.short = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{rtn.long}{an xts,timeSeries or zoo object of long portfolio returns,which must be 1 column}

\item{rtn.short}{an xts,timeSeries or zoo object of benchmark or short portfolio returns,which must be 1 column}

\item{rebFreq}{an interval specification, one of "day", "week", "month", "quarter" and "year", optionally preceded by an integer and a space, or followed by "s".See \code{\link{cut.Date}} for detail.}

\item{weight}{a time series or single-row matrix(vector) containing asset weights. If a vector,the weights time series will be computed automatically via different rebFreq. See example for detail.}

\item{fee.long}{a numeric, giving the Unilateral transaction fee of long asset}

\item{fee.short}{a numeric, giving the Unilateral transaction fee of short asset}
}
\value{
a \bold{rtn.LSH} object of class xts,giving the return series of long,short and hedge.
}
\description{
Add the hedged return on the long and short return series.
}
\details{
Note that the rowsum of weight is not required to be equal to 1. If the portfolio is not full position, then the sum of weight could be smaller than 1; If credit and short is allowed, then the sum of weight could be smaller than 0 or larger than 1.

\examples{
rtn.long <- zoo(rnorm(1000,0.001,0.02),as.Date("2010-01-01")+1:1000)
rtn.short <- rtn.long + rnorm(1000,-0.0001,0.003)
rebFreq <- "month"
# use the default weight: full position hedging, rebalancing by month
re <- addrtn.hedge(rtn.long,rtn.short,rebFreq,c(1,-1))
# 70 percent postion hedging,rebalancing by month
re2 <- addrtn.hedge(rtn.long,rtn.short,rebFreq,c(0.7,-0.7))
# use the time series weight
wgt.idx <- unique(as.Date(cut(zoo::index(rtn.long),"month")))
wgt <- xts(matrix(rep(c(0.7,-0.7),each=length(wgt.idx)),length(wgt.idx),2),wgt.idx)
re3 <- addrtn.hedge(rtn.long,rtn.short,weight=wgt) # the same as re2
